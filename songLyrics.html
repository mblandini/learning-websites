<h1>Gospel Of Dismay</h1>
<h3>Song by DAGames</h3>
<p>You joined the underground cabaret today</p>
<p>Oh hey there, tell me your name</p>
<p>You try to run and tell the world</p>
<p>But you're stranded in a darkened cave</p>
<p>Oh Henry we hate you the same</p>
<p>So listen up my friend</p>
<p>There's more that meets the eye</p>
<p>You power up the studio</p>
<p>And bring them to life</p>
<p>Now play the beat that trickles</p>
<p>Through the halls</p>
<p>Or else your life is nevermore</p>
<p>Don't worry chum</p>
<p>It's not the music that dies</p>
<p>Now listen up</p>
<p>Our life support machine</p>
<p>Was brought to life by remarkable hands</p>
<p>Forget about the hell we've seen</p>
<p>The time has come to revive our band</p>
<p>So bang the drums to a rhythm</p>
<p>Captivating the beat</p>
<p>And press the keys on the piano</p>
<p>For the ritual please</p>
<p>The song's alive with the night</p>
<p>With your help we'll revive</p>
<p>The devil's advocate</p>
<p>Is staring right through your lies</p>
<br />
<p>You're just returning our old strings tonight</p>
<p>I hope you turn up the light now</p>
<p><strong>Can I get an amen in here? <em>(AMEN)</em></strong></p>
<p>You see the magic of art</p>
<p>It would tear you apart if you knew</p>
<p><strong>Can I get an amen in here? <em>(AMEN)</em></strong></p>
<p>This magic is fueled by your heart</p>
<p>But the dreams in his eyes were untrue He had bigger plans for the band</p>
<p>By demand</p>
<p>We came back to his darkened cell</p>
<p>You're going to break us out of this hell</p>
<br />
<p>We've been stars since the rhythm days</p>
<p>But our instruments have all grown tired</p>
<p>And in the end our only dream was to dance</p>
<p>They took the dance away we got retired</p>
<p>But that was long ago</p>
<p>We have a new chance of face</p>
<p>We've turned it up a couple notches with a brand new pace</p>
<p>You think that they all just erased us</p>
<p>Betrayed us, enslaved us</p>
<p>But the deed is done</p>
<p>And now we want to get out</p>
<p>Now listen up</p>
<p>Ain't it nice to be underground</p>
<p>With a good ol' friend like me</p>
<p>So you notice that sign, we ain't lying</p>
<p>But sit down and take a seat</p>
<p>There's an exit for sure</p>
<p>But that's for shmucks</p>
<p>But a little bit of ink</p>
<p>And a couple of bucks</p>
<p>We can reopen the curtains</p>
<p>And show off the strut</p>
<p>But for goodness sake</p>
<p>You gotta just believe</p>
<br />
<p>You're just returning our old strings tonight</p>
<p>I hope you turn up the light now</p>
<p><strong>Can I get an amen in here? <em>(AMEN)</em></strong></p>
<p>You see the magic of art</p>
<p>It would tear you apart if you knew</p>
<p><strong>Can I get an amen in here? <em>(AMEN)</em></strong></p>
<p>This magic is fueled by your heart</p>
<p>But the dreams in his eyes were untrue He had bigger plans for the band</p>
<p>By demand</p>
<p>We came back to his darkened cell</p>
<p>You're going to break us out</p>
<br />
<p>Go to sleep my little sheep</p>
<p>It's time to rest your head</p>
<p>Whether alive or dead</p>
<p>I am the keeper of the key</p>
<p>That will set us all free</p>
<p>I bring the demon back to life</p>
<p>There's a song I sing that shows us the light</p>
<p>Even in the lighter side of hell</p>
<p>We sing with delight</p>
<p>Play the notes that I require</p>
<p>This will please my desire</p>
<p>You have given me the tools to restart this fire</p>
<br />
<p>There's a twisted fate</p>
<p>That controls us, and betrays us</p>
<p>My friends have a death wish</p>
<p>And all of this is him to blame</p>
<p>Now we've brought him to his knees</p>
<p>Your only hope to escape this</p>
<p>Is to embrace this</p>
<p>We need your help to keep this demon at bay</p>
<p>Let's end this today</p>
<br />
<p>You're the conductor of this performance now Henry</p>
<p>Will you take their word, or ours</p>
<p>Golly I hope this works</p>
<p>You turned on this machine</p>
<p>Now you have to believe</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Can I get an amen in here?</strong></p>
<p>You see the magic of art</p>
<p>It would tear you apart if you knew</p>
<p><strong>Can I get an amen in here?</strong></p>
<p>This magic is fueled by your heart</p>
<p>But the dreams in his eyes were untrue He had bigger plans for the band</p>
<p>By demand</p>
<p>We came back to this world of grey</p>
<br />
<p><strong>WELCOME TO THE GOSPEL OF DISMAY!</strong></p>
<br />
<p>Welcome to the gospel of dismay...</p>
